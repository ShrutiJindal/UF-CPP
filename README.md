# UF-Coding/Programming Practice
UF-CPP is a self organized small size coding practice Meetup. This repository holds the coding challenges in every Meetup as a resource for future reference. More info about the group can be found in our [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/453423804992985/). For every question commit/merge to the repository, you should put the [README template file](./q_template.md) in the question/problem folder as a README file, rename it to README.md using command `cp q_template.md path_to_q_folder/README.md`
