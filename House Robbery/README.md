## Brief Intro
Tags: ___DP___, ___easy___.
A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can hop either 1step, 2 steps, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.

## Source
* from CCI page 134. Solution/hints on page 342.

## Complexity/Analysis
The optimal solution can achieve ___O(N)___ time and ___O(N^2)___ space. Or another solution and achieve xxxxxxx.

## Notes
This question is actually an upgraded version of Fibonacci number.
Using brutal force/recursion will result stack overflow/timeout. Time complexity will be ___O(3^n)___. Memoization solution can achieve ___O(n)___ space and ___O(n)___ time.
