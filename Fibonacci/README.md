## Brief Intro
Tags: ___DP___, ___easy___.
In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.

## Complexity/Analysis
The optimal solution can achieve ___O(N)___ time and ___O(N^2)___ space. Or another solution and achieve xxxxxxx.

## Notes
* The Memoization solution can achieve ___O(N)___ time and ___O(N)___ space
* The recursion solution (most intuitive one) will have ___O(2^N)___ time complexity.
* We can use only two variables to hold the first and second number. With the iterative solution, time complexity will be ___O(N)___ and space complexity will be ___O(1)___ .
